<p>Contents:</p>

<p>- one board with 81 squares;</p>

<p>- two storage slots for the fences;</p>

<p>- 20 fences and 2 pawns.</p>

<p></p>

<p>PURPOSE OF THE GAME</p>

<p>To be the first to reach the line opposite to one's base line (fig.7).</p>

<p></p>

<p>RULES FOR 2 PLAYERS</p>

<p>When the game starts the fences are placed in their storage area (10 for
each player).</p>

<p>Each player places his pawn in the centre of his base line (fig.1).</p>

<p>A draw will determine who starts first.</p>

<p></p>

<p>How To Play The Game Quoridor:</p>

<p>Each player in turn, chooses to move his pawn or to put up one of his
fences.</p>

<p>When he has run out of fences, the player must move his pawn.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Pawn moves</p>

<p>The pawns are moved one square at a time, horizontally or vertically,
forwards or backwards (fig.2).</p>

<p>The pawns must get around the fences (fig.3).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Positioning of the fences</p>

<p>The fences must be placed between 2 sets of 2 squares (fig.4).</p>

<p>The fences can be used to facilitate the player&rsquo;s progress or to
impede that of the opponent, however, an acess to the goal line must always
be left open (fig.5).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Face to face</p>

<p>When two pawns face each other on neighbouring squares which are not
separated by a fence, the player whose turn it is can jump the
opponent&rsquo;s pawn (and place himself behind him), thus advancing an extra
square (fig.6). If there is a fence behind the said pawn, the player can
place his pawn to the left or the right of the other pawn (fig.8 and 9).</p>

<p></p>

<p>END OF GAME</p>

<p>The first player who reaches one of the 9 squares opposite his base line
is the winner (fig. 7).</p>

<p></p>

<p>TIME OF GAME</p>

<p>From 10 to 20 minutes.</p>

<p>In a tournament, it possible to allocate a set time to each player.</p>
